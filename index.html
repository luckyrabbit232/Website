        Zara is an impressive global company. However, its website is surprisingly bad for such a large company. 
        Several reasons for this includes the horrible typefaces and an extremely confusing navigation system. I will first analyze
        the usability, learnability, memorability, and accessibility to explain why Zara has a poor website design.
      </div>
    </div>

      <div class = "introduction_Title">
        <strong>Usability:</strong>
      </div>
      <div class = "introduction_Text">
        the goal of the user is to quickly browse through the jacket section, compare prices and style, and then choose the type that fits the user the most. However, Zaraâ€™s website fails in aiding the user in achieving his/her goal through several points:
      </div>
      <div class = "introduction_Text">
       <strong>User Control:</strong>  There are buttons that lead you into a page, but no buttons to lead you out so that you can easily navigate to other clothing sections      
      </div>
      <div class = "introduction_Text">
        <strong>Affordances:</strong>   There are a lot of buttons that have poor direction on what they do and how to use them.

       </div>
       <div class = "introduction_Text">
        <strong>Consistency:</strong>  Some categories list out all the clothing related to the category in an online store format, and some categories only list a special style with descriptions that is reminiscent of an art exhibition. They are scattered and confuse the user.
       </div>
      <div class = "introduction_Title">
        <strong>Learnability:</strong>
      </div>
      <div class = "introduction_Text">
        Zara makes it tough to know where to navigate, and how to navigate. I will outline several specific problems below:
      </div>

      <div class = "introduction_Text">
        <strong>Clothing Size: </strong>The button to choose a clothing sign is a button with a plus inside. There is nothing beside it mentioning its function.
      </div>

      <div class = "introduction_Text">
        <strong>Filters: </strong>There are no indications on what the filter is referring to. There are pictures of clothes that do not have any price, and some that do.
      </div>

      <div class = "introduction_Text">
        <strong>Clothing Selection: </strong>For the category that is shown as an art exhibition format, it is especially odd that the showcase pictures and the clothes being sold are both clickable. Keep it consistent.
      </div>

      <div class = "introduction_Title">
        <strong>Memorability:</strong>
      </div>

      <div class = "introduction_Text">
        Zara makes it hard to remember where you are on the website. Several major problems are  detailed below:
      </div>

      <div class = "introduction_Text">
        <strong>Origin: </strong>There is nothing to remind you which links you have gone through to get to the category. This ties in with the lack of buttons to help you backtrack.
      </div>

      <div class = "introduction_Text">
        <strong>Whitespace: </strong>There is a lot of whitespaces between the images. This makes it hard for users to compare the images to see the difference in styles, and which one suits their taste better.
      </div>

      <div class = "introduction_Text">
        <strong>Location: </strong>For the art exhibition category style, there are no sidebars to help you navigate through the different styles, and also the name of the style you last saw.
      </div>

      <div class = "introduction_Title">
       <strong> Accessibility:</strong>
      </div>

      <div class = "introduction_Text">
        I will be using WAIVE to help in my critique of the accessibility of the Zara webpage. Several WAIVE suggestions are listed below:
      </div>

      <div class = "introduction_Text">
        <strong>Empty Button: </strong>The clothing size button is just a circle with a plus. No adjacent text and no affordances nearby to suggest that the button is meant for clothing sizes.

      </div>

      <div class = "introduction_Text">
        <strong>Redundant Link: </strong>There is a redundant link for the clothing because the name of the clothing and the image direct to the same link. I believe that it does not matter too much, but it might be good to keep it to the image or the hypertext to maintain consistency.

      </div>
      <div class = "introduction_Text">
        <strong>Very Small Text: </strong> For the description of the type of category, WAIVE mentions that the text is very small. This is true especially since the description is a subtitle. To separate the subtitle from the normal text, it should be enlarged or otherwise removed if it is not important.
      </div>

      <div id="cs1300-gallery">
        <div class = "introduction_Title">
          <strong>Visual Redesign:</strong>
        </div>
        <div class = "introduction_Text">
          In this section, I will be using the problems listed above to improve the Zara website. I will first use Balsamiq to create a wireframe as a low-fidelity prototype. 
        </div>
        <div class = "gallery-container">
          <img class = "redesign_desktop_balsamiq" src="assets/PC.png">

          <strong>Visual Design Guide:</strong>
        </div>
        <div class = "introduction_Text">
          Next is the visual design guide. In order to maintain the design philosophy of the original website, a contrasting colour focus was used along with several reused assets.
        </div>
        <div class = "gallery-container">

          The high-fidelity prototype for desktop, tablet, and mobile versions are outlined below.
